Then in the XVIII century it was given a modern meaning alluding to one who practises a science, art, sport\u0026hellip; without the need to be professional for it, but it was not until the XIX century that the amateur word was implemented as a sporting term.\nFor myself, I honor the amateur spirit upon which the sport was founded and champion the Running Class - the non-professional yet competitive runners dedicated to the pursuit of personal excellence.\nAnyone who knows me will know that one of my passions are endurance sports, with specially attention to marathons.\nI believe in competition and the meritocracy of racing. Not because winning and losing are particularly important, but because competition sends us on an innately human journey. A large part of training for a marathon is learning from your mistakes. Runners must listen to their bodies and decide when to train, and when not to train, based on how they cope will all they put the body through. The profound physical and mental demands of training and racing lead to a richer and more sensitive and thrilling life. In my experience, I\u0026rsquo;ve gained a lot of humility and perseverance for completing the marathon distance.\nFurthermore, I usually combine this passion with other of my hobbies, meet new landscapes and communities\u0026hellip; I consider that traveling cross-world is a fulfilling way to enhance each marathon experience. It has led me to participate in several marathons around the world, trying to improve, in each one of my participations, my personal record.\nLast April 15 I set my personal best time in the Boston Marathon, my first Major. For those who are not familiar with this term, a Major is the conversational style to call a marathon which belongs to the Abbott World Marathon Majors. A series consisting of six of the largest and most renowned marathons in the world. The races take place in Tokyo, Boston, London, Berlin, Chicago and New York City.\nI can\u0026rsquo;t be happier about my first participation in a Major, because I broke my personal record, setting up a finishing time of 02h48\u0026rsquo;23\u0026rdquo;, which represent a pace of 3\u0026rsquo;59\u0026rdquo;/km (15.04 km/h).\nIn this plot you can find all my participations and my personal progression in the Philippides (\u0026Phi;\u0026iota;\u0026lambda;\u0026iota;\u0026pi;\u0026pi;\u0026iacute;\u0026delta;\u0026eta;\u0026sigmaf;) distance.\nIf you want to dive into my personal marathon participation statistics I invite you to check this summary table.\nMoreover, in the following table you can see the all-time top-5 marathoners (men and women), which reflects that human beings have no limits.\n Source: World Athletics (before International Association of Athletics Federations, IAAF) \nIn each of my training programs for the marathon I take notes that help me improve my performance, as well as embody my personal experiences. Remembering the notes I usually take, the plots shown in this post are made using the R package xkcd, which represents the traces of handwriting.\nLast but not least, I want to share with you this quote of \u0026ldquo;Born to Run: A Hidden Tribe, Superathletes, and the Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen\u0026rdquo; book, a must to be read if you want to be consider as a marathoner:\n  \"Every morning in Africa, a gazelle wakes up, it knows it must outrun the fastest lion or it will be killed. Every morning in Africa, a lion wakes up. It knows it must run faster than the slowest gazelle, or it will starve. It doesn't matter whether you're the lion or a gazelle-when the sun comes up, you'd better be running.\" -Christopher McDougall  ","date":1576195200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576195200,"objectID":"0e81f6b7d16bb1f2ed35beeb6ad9075a","permalink":"/post/20191213_amateur/","publishdate":"2019-12-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/20191213_amateur/","section":"post","summary":"Amateur is a word taken from French, that was present in that language since the XV century, after replacing the popular form \u0026ldquo;amaor\u0026rdquo;, which derives from the Latin \u0026ldquo;amator\u0026rdquo; meaning \u0026ldquo;who loves\u0026rdquo;.

My name is Manuel Revilla and I am so excited to share with you all my contributions to the scientific world gathered together in one website. The amount of ideas, how-to\u0026rsquo;s and inspiration whirling around in my head is ready to jump out.\n \u0026middot; Why I started my website/blog \u0026middot; \nI wanted to start by telling you why I created this blog, what you will be seeing more of in my posts, and my overall experience of creating my website.\nSince I started in academia, I have witnessed the emergence of huge amount of vias to share and disseminate our scientific contributions to an specific area of knowledge and the general public. All of them, to a greater or lesser extent, fulfill their purpose. But sometimes we miss out on valuable information among the wide range of communication channels available. That\u0026rsquo;s why I decided to create this website as an official way of communication, an make you easier to know more and more about my professional progession as a researcher.\n \u0026middot; First of all, I apologize \u0026middot; \nEnglish writing has never been a strong suite of mine and I will tell you, I am no expert on any of this. I try to be a \u0026ldquo;perfectionist\u0026rdquo; but I am nowhere near perfect. I figure it will be a lot of trial and error so please bear with me on any grammar/spelling mistakes.\n \u0026middot; Enjoy the experience of building your own website/blog \u0026middot; \nAfter being inspired to start my website/blog, I wanted to create them in a professional way and would allow me to make updates in a simple and fast way. I could have gone to a web designer, but in that case I would have lost the experience of creating on my own. Taking advantage of my skills in R environment, I decided to built it using RStudio open-source. As a researcher I am used to work programming in R to perform statistical and data analysis, so why not develop my own website using this language and have fun throughout the entire process\u0026hellip; This means I would be able to maintain my website in R, have a lot more flexibility and control over the look of my website.\nIn the next lines I summarize the steps I follow to create my website. For a more detail guideline you can consult the extremely helpful blog of Alison Hill.\n Setting up GitHub Pages:    Create a GitHub account   On your dashboard, create a New Repository (your_username.github.io)   Create a local copy of this repository     Launch RStudio and create a New Project. Navigate to the folder above the working directory you just created from GitHub.    Install blogdown  package in your RStudio console:## Install from CRAN install.packages(\"blogdown\") ## Or, install from GitHub if (!requireNamespace(\"devtools\")) install.packages(\"devtools\") devtools::install_github(\"rstudio/blogdown\")    Install Hugo using the blogdown package helper function:blogdown::install_hugo() # or library(blogdown) install_hugo()    Build your site by choosing the Hugo themes that you like the most. If you belong to the academia field, Hugo Academic Theme could be a good choice, this theme offers all the sections present in a standard curriculum vitae with a clean simple interface:# create a new site with the academic theme blogdown::new_site(theme = \".../hugo-academic\", theme_example = TRUE)    Configurate and customizate according your personal preferences. A complete guideline for the Hugo Academic theme can be find here. Running locally blogdown:::serve_site() in your RStudio project is especially useful as you can inmediately see the changes you have perform. If you would like to have Google monitor the analytics for your site so that you can study traffic flow on your pages, you will need to enable Google Analytics. First, sign up here.

In a perspective of safe and sustainable food systems, reducing the use of antibiotics in livestock is a major concern. In fact, antibiotic resistance is one of the major medical challenges of the 21st century. The transfer of genes conferring resistance through the environment and the food chain, the potential for development of resistant bacteria and the appearance of therapeutic failures in human medicine, notably due to zoonotic bacteria, constitute major health issues for livestock farming sectors.\nIn the pig breeding industry, the weaning period is often accompanied by a decreased growth rate caused by disparate food intake and diarrhoea due to digestive disorders that might be associated with bacterial population disequilibrium (i.e. dysbiosis) and/or opportunistic intestinal infections. Alarmingly, during this transition period the prophylactic use of antibiotics is still very frequent in order to limit piglet morbidity and mortality. Thus, reducing the prophylactic use of antibiotics in weaning pigs is a main issue and there is a strong need for alternatives. In this context, we have built a public-private partnership that gathers INRA scientists and industries from economic sectors of both animal feeding and pig breeding. PigletBiota is a precompetitive project that will study the physiological and genetic bases of the piglet sensitivity at weaning, as a prerequisite to identify innovative actions to adapt animals and pig production systems to a reduction of antibiotic use.\nThe global aim of the PIGLETBIOTA project is to develop research that will contribute to adapt pig production systems to a reduction of antibiotics. The project proposes an integrative biology approach to determine the main factors influencing the variability of the individual\u0026rsquo;s robustness at weaning. We will monitor piglets for health, immune, stress and zootechnical traits and will characterize the intestinal microbiota diversity and composition as well as the contribution of host\u0026rsquo;s genotypes. The experimental design will combine various environments, including experimental and commercial farms, and ages at weaning and all animals will be fed without antibiotics. Animals (n~1000) will be clinically surveyed, measured for various traits related to production, immunity and stress, and genotyped with high-density SNP chips. The genetic parameters of the sensitivity at weaning will be estimated and genetic association studies performed. Faecal samples before and after the weaning date will be collected for characterizing the dynamics of the gut microbiota and studying its influence on the individual sensitivity at weaning. Animal and microbiota data will be vertically integrated in order to better understand the interplay between the these two levels of this biological system, and to develop robust indicators of weaning sensitivity. Finally, a functional screening using INRA platforms dedicated to human studies will be performed in order to detect active molecules to be tested in vivo and by using an axenic pigs model. The PigletBiota public-private consortium will favor translational research and innovation.\n","date":1575158400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575158400,"objectID":"657f2f52debc503ab26760b9c1b4ebfe","permalink":"/project/pigletbiota-project/","publishdate":"2019-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/pigletbiota-project/","section":"project","summary":"An integrative biology-based study of the influence of intestinal microbiota composition on piglet robustness at weaning in a perspective of a limited use of antibiotics in livestock production.","tags":null,"title":"PIGLETBIOTA project","type":"project"},{"authors":["Manuel Revilla","Nicolas C Friggens","Laurent\u0026#150;Philippe Broudiscou","Ga\u0026euml;tan Lemonnier","Fany Blanc","Laure Ravon","Marie\u0026#150;Jos\u0026eacute; Mercat","Yvon Billon","Claire Rogel\u0026#150;Gaillard","Nathalie Le Floch","Jordi Estell\u0026eacute;","Rafael Mu\u0026ntilde;oz\u0026#150;Tamayo"],"categories":null,"content":"Full citation  Revilla, M. , Friggens, N.C., Broudiscou, L., Lemonnier, G., Blanc, F., Ravon, L., Mercat, J.M., Billon, Y., Rogel-Gaillard, R., Le Floch, N., Estell\u0026eacute;, J., Mu\u0026ntilde;oz\u0026#150;Tamayo, R.

During this period, the prophylactic use of antibiotics is still frequent to limit piglet morbidity, which raises both economic and public health concerns such as the appearance of antimicrobial-resistant microbes. With the interest of developing tools for assisting health and management decisions around weaning, it is key to provide robustness indexes that inform on the animals' capacity to endure the challenges associated with weaning. This work aimed at developing a modelling approach for facilitating the quantification of piglet resilience to weaning. A total of 325 Large White pigs weaned at 28 days of age were monitored and further housed and fed conventionally during the post-weaning period without antibiotic administration. Body weight and diarrhoea scores were recorded before and after weaning, and blood was sampled at weaning and 1 week later for collecting haematological data. A dynamic model was constructed based on the Gompertz-Makeham law to describe live weight trajectories during the first 75 days after weaning, following the rationale that the animal response is partitioned in two time windows (a perturbation and a recovery window). Model calibration was performed for each animal. Our results show that the transition time between the two time windows, as well as the weight trajectories are characteristic for each individual. The model captured the weight dynamics of animals at different degrees of perturbation, with an average coefficient of determination of 0.99, and a concordance correlation coefficient of 0.99. The utility of the model is that it provides biologically meaningful parameters that inform on the amplitude and length of perturbation, and the rate of animal recovery. Our rationale is that the dynamics of weight inform on the capability of the animal to cope with the weaning disturbance. Indeed, there were significant correlations between model parameters and individual diarrhoea scores and haematological traits. Overall, the parameters of our model can be useful for constructing weaning robustness indexes by using exclusively the growth curves. We foresee that this modelling approach will provide a step forward in the quantitative characterisation of robustness.","tags":null,"title":"Towards the quantitative characterisation of piglets' robustness to weaning: a modelling approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Daniel Crespo\u0026#150;Piazuelo","Lourdes Criado\u0026#150;Mesas","Manuel Revilla","Anna Castell\u0026oacute;","Ana I Fern\u0026aacute;ndez","Josep M Folch","Maria Ballester"],"categories":null,"content":"Full citation  Crespo\u0026#150;Piazuelo, D., Criado\u0026#150;Mesas, L., Revilla, M., Castell\u0026oacute;, A., Fern\u0026aacute;ndez, A.I., Folch, J.M., Ballester, M.

Through processes of natural adaptation and selective breeding, the accumulation of mutations has driven the genetic divergence between pig breeds. The most common and well-studied mutations are single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). However, insertions and deletions (indels) usually represents a fifth part of the detected mutations and should also be considered for animal breeding. In the present study, three different programs (Dindel, SAMtools mpileup, and GATK) were used to detect indels from Whole Genome Sequencing data of Iberian boars and Landrace sows. A total of 1,928,746 indels were found in common with the three programs. The VEP tool predicted that 1,289 indels may have a high impact on protein sequence and function. Ten indels inside genes related with lipid metabolism were genotyped in pigs from three different backcrosses with Iberian origin, obtaining different allelic frequencies on each backcross. Genome-Wide Association Studies performed in the Longissimus dorsi muscle found an association between an indel located in the C1q and TNF related 12 (C1QTNF12) gene and the amount of eicosadienoic acid (C20:2(n-6)).","tags":null,"title":"Indel detection from Whole Genome Sequencing data and association with lipid metabolism in pigs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Daniel Crespo\u0026#150;Piazuelo","Lourdes Migura\u0026#150;Garcia","Jordi Estell\u0026eacute;","Lourdes Criado\u0026#150;Mesas","Manuel Revilla","Anna Castell\u0026oacute;","Mar\u0026iacute;a Mu\u0026ntilde;oz","Juan M.

A total of 1,261 operational taxonomic units were obtained and grouped in 18 phyla and 101 genera. Firmicutes (45.36%) and Bacteroidetes (37.47%) were the two major phyla obtained, whereas at genus level Prevotella (7.03%) and Treponema (6.29%) were the most abundant. Pigs were also genotyped with a high-throughput method for 45,508 single nucleotide polymorphisms that covered the entire pig genome. Subsequently, genome-wide association studies were made among the genotypes of these pigs and their gut microbiota composition. A total of 52 single-nucleotide polymorphisms distributed in 17 regions along the pig genome were associated with the relative abundance of six genera; Akkermansia, CF231, Phascolarctobacterium, Prevotella, SMB53, and Streptococcus.

The aim of this study was to describe the microbiome composition, distribution and interaction along the Iberian pig intestinal tract and its role in whole-body energy homeostasis. The V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced from the microbiomes of five gut sections (duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and proximal and distal colon) in thirteen castrated male pigs. A total of 1,669 operational taxonomic units distributed in 179 genera were found among all samples. The two most abundant genera in the small intestine were Lactobacillus and Clostridium, while Prevotella was predominant in the colon. The colon samples were more similar among the pigs and richer in species than the small intestine samples were. In the small intestine, the metagenome prediction pointed to rapid internalization and conversion of the available simple carbohydrates for microbial proliferation and maintenance. In the colon, a competition among anaerobic bacteria for plant polysaccharide degradation to produce short chain fatty acids was found. This study confirms that the energy pathways of the gut microbiome differ along its sections and provides a description of the correlations between genera.","tags":null,"title":"Characterization of bacterial microbiota compositions along the intestinal tract in pigs and their interactions and functions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Manuel Revilla","Anna Puig\u0026#150;Oliveras","Daniel Crespo\u0026#150;Piazuelo","Lourdes Criado\u0026#150;Mesas","Anna Castell\u0026oacute;","Ana I Fern\u0026aacute;ndez","Maria Ballester","Josep M Folch"],"categories":null,"content":"Full citation  Revilla, M., Puig\u0026#150;Oliveras, A., Crespo\u0026#150;Piazuelo, D., Criado\u0026#150;Mesas, L., Castell\u0026oacute;, A., Fern\u0026aacute;ndez, A.I., Ballester, M., Folch, J.M.

A total of 193 expression-associated SNPs located in 19 chromosomal regions were associated with expression levels of ACSM5, ELOVL6, FABP4, FADS2, and SLC27A4 genes. Three expression quantitative trail loci (eQTLs) corresponding to ACSM5, FABP4, and FADS2 were classified as cis-acting eQTLs, whereas the remaining 16 eQTLs have trans-regulatory effects. Remarkably, a SNP in the ACSM5 promoter region and a SNP in the 3'UTR region of FABP4 were the most associated polymorphisms with the ACSM5 and FABP4 expression levels, respectively. Moreover, relevant lipid-related genes mapped in the trans-eQTLs regions associated with the ACSM5, FABP4, FADS2, and SLC27A4 genes. Interestingly, a trans-eQTL hotspot on SSC13 regulating the gene expression of ELOVL6, ELOLV5, and SCD, three important genes implicated in the elongation and desaturation of fatty acids, was identified.

Polymorphisms in these genes, FABP4:g.2634_2635insC and FABP5:g.3000T\u0026gt;G, have previously been associated with fatness traits in an Iberian by Landrace cross (IBMAP). The aim of the present work was to evaluate the functional implication of these genetic variants. For this purpose, FABP4 and FABP5 mRNA expression levels in 114 BC1_LD animals (25% Iberian x 75% Landrace) were analyzed using real\u0026#150;time quantitative PCR in backfat and muscle. FABP4 gene expression in backfat, but not in muscle, was associated with FABP4:g.2634_2635insC. In contrast, FABP5:g.3000T\u0026gt;G was not associated with gene expression levels. An expression\u0026#150;based genome\u0026#150;wide association study highlighted the FABP4:g.2634_2635insC polymorphism as the polymorphism most associated with FABP4 gene expression in backfat.

Hence, understanding the molecular mechanisms affecting meat production and quality would help in the selection of these traits. Meat quality is determined largely by its fatty acid (FA) composition and understanding the underlying molecular processes of FA composition is the general objective of this thesis. We analyzed quantitative trait loci (QTL) on porcine chromosome 8 (SCC8) for FA composition in backfat, identifying two trait-associated SNP regions at 93 Mb and 119 Mb. The strongest statistical signals for both regions were observed for palmitoleic acid and, C18:0/C16:0 and C18:1(n-7)/C16:1(n-7) elongation ratios. MAML3 and SETD7 genes were analyzed as positional candidate genes in the 93 Mb region. The two novel microsatellites analyzed in the MAML3 gene, and the SETD7:c.700GT SNP in the SETD7 gene did not show the strongest signal in this region, discarding these polymorphisms as the causal mutations. Furthermore, in the 119 Mb region, the ELOVL6:c.-533CT SNP showed a strong association with the percentage of palmitic and palmitoleic acids and elongation ratios in backfat. These results for ELOVL6 gene, support the hypothesis that it has a pleiotropic effect in backfat and muscle for the 119 Mb QTL, and reinforce this gene as a strong candidate for the SSC8 QTL for FA composition. Moreover, whole genome sequence (WGS) data from Iberian and Landrace pigs were used to identify 1,279 copy number variations (CNVs), merging into 540 swine CNV regions (CNVRs). The impact of four of them in growth and FA composition in intramuscular fat and backfat was studied. Association with carcass length and FA composition in backfat and intramuscular fat was showed for the CNVR112, containing the GPAT2 gene which catalyse the biosynthesis of triglycerides and glycerophospholipids. These results underline the importance of CNVRs affecting economically important traits in pigs. Finally, the adipose tissue mRNA expression of 44 candidate genes related with lipid metabolism was analyzed in 115 animals. The expression genome-wide association (eGWAS) identified 193 eSNPs located in 19 expression QTLs (eQTLs). Three out of 19 eQTLs corresponding to ACSM5, FABP4, and FADS2 were classified as cis-acting eQTLs, whereas the remaining 16 eQTLs had trans-regulatory effects. These findings and the polymorphisms evaluated for some of these genes provide new data to further understand the functional mechanisms implicated in the variation of meat quality traits in pigs.

In the present study, a genomic analysis of porcine CNVs based on next-generation sequencing data was carried out to identify CNVs segregating in an Iberian x Landrace backcross population and study their association with fatty acid composition and growth-related traits. A total of 1,279 CNVs, including duplications and deletions, were detected, ranging from 106 to 235 CNVs across samples, with an average of 183 CNVs per sample. Moreover, we detected 540 CNV regions (CNVRs) containing 245 genes. Functional annotation suggested that these genes possess a great variety of molecular functions and may play a role in production traits in commercial breeds. Some of the identified CNVRs contained relevant functional genes (e.g., CLCA4, CYP4X1, GPAT2, MOGAT2, PLA2G2A and PRKG1, among others). The variation in copy number of four of them (CLCA4, GPAT2, MOGAT2 and PRKG1) was validated in 150 BC1_LD (25% Iberian and 75% Landrace) animals by qPCR. Additionally, their contribution regarding backfat and intramuscular fatty acid composition and growth-related traits was analyzed. Statistically significant associations were obtained for CNVR112 (GPAT2) for the C18:2(n-6)/C18:3(n-3) ratio in backfat and carcass length, among others. Notably, GPATs are enzymes that catalyze the first step in the biosynthesis of both triglycerides and glycerophospholipids, suggesting that this CNVR may contribute to genetic variation in fatty acid composition and growth traits. These findings provide useful genomic information to facilitate the further identification of trait-related CNVRs affecting economically important traits in pigs.","tags":null,"title":"A global analysis of CNVs in swine using whole genome sequence data and association analysis with fatty acid composition and growth traits","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maria Ballester","Yuliaxis Ramayo\u0026#150;Caldas","Manuel Revilla","Jordi Corominas","Anna Castell\u0026oacute;","Jordi Estell\u0026eacute;","Ana I Fern\u0026aacute;ndez","Josep M Folch"],"categories":null,"content":"Full citation  Ballester, M., Ramayo\u0026#150;Caldas, Y., Revilla, M., Corominas, J., Castell\u0026oacute;, A., Estell\u0026eacute;, J., Fern\u0026aacute;ndez, A.I., Folch, J.M.

The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) ELOVL6\u0026#58;c.\u0026#150;533C \u0026gt; T located in the promoter region of ELOVL6 was found to be highly associated with ELOVL6 expression and, accordingly, with the percentages of palmitic and palmitoleic acids in longissimus dorsi and adipose tissue. The main goal of the current work was to further study the role of ELOVL6 on these traits by analyzing the regulation of the expression of ELOVL6 and the implication of ELOVL6 polymorphisms on meat quality traits in pigs. High\u0026#150;throughput sequencing of BAC clones that contain the porcine ELOVL6 gene coupled to RNAseq data re\u0026#150;analysis showed that two isoforms of this gene are expressed in liver and adipose tissue and that they differ in number of exons and 3\u0026acute;UTR length. Although several SNPs in the 3\u0026acute;UTR of ELOVL6 were associated with palmitic and palmitoleic acid contents, this association was lower than that previously observed with SNP ELOVL6\u0026#58;c.\u0026#150;533C \u0026gt; T. This SNP is in full linkage disequilibrium with SNP ELOVL6\u0026#58;c.\u0026#150;394G \u0026gt; A that was identified in the binding site for estrogen receptor alpha (ER\u0026alpha;). Interestingly, the ELOVL6\u0026#58;c.\u0026#150;394G allele is associated with an increase in methylation levels of the ELOVL6 promoter and with a decrease of ELOVL6 expression. Therefore, ER\u0026alpha; is clearly a good candidate to explain the regulation of ELOVL6 expression through dynamic epigenetic changes in the binding site of known regulators of ELOVL6 gene, such as SREBF1 and SP1.

The use of network approaches considering the interactions of multiple molecules and traits provides useful insights into the molecular underpinnings of complex traits. Here, a network based methodology, named Association Weight Matrix, was applied to study gene interactions and pathways affecting pig conformation, growth and fatness traits. The co\u0026#150;association network analysis underpinned three transcription factors, PPAR\u0026gamma;, ELF1, and PRDM16 involved in mesoderm tissue differentiation. Fifty\u0026#150;four genes in the network belonged to growth\u0026#150;related ontologies and 46 of them were common with a similar study for growth in cattle supporting our results. The functional analysis uncovered the lipid metabolism and the corticotrophin and gonadotrophin release hormone pathways among the most important pathways influencing these traits. Our results suggest that the genes and pathways here identified are important determining either the total body weight of the animal and the fat content. For instance, a switch in the mesoderm tissue differentiation may determinate the age\u0026#150;related preferred pathways being in the puberty stage those related with the miogenic and osteogenic lineages; on the contrary, in the maturity stage cells may be more prone to the adipocyte fate. Hence, our results demonstrate that an integrative genomic co\u0026#150;association analysis is a powerful approach for identifying new connections and interactions among genes. This work provides insights about pathways and key regulators which may be important determining the animal growth, conformation and body proportions and fatness traits.

A QTL (quantitative trait locus) for fatty acid composition in backfat was previously detected on porcine chromosome 8 (SSC8) in an Iberian x Landrace F2 intercross. More recently, a genome\u0026#150;wide association study detected the same genomic region for muscle fatty acid composition in an Iberian x Landrace backcross population. ELOVL6, a strong positional candidate gene for this QTL, contains a polymorphism in its promoter region (ELOVL6\u0026#58;c.\u0026#150;533C \u0026lt; T), which is associated with percentage of palmitic and palmitoleic acids in muscle and adipose tissues. Here, a combination of single\u0026#150;marker association and the haplotype\u0026#150;based approach was used to analyze backfat fatty acid composition in 470 animals of an Iberian x Landrace F2 intercross genotyped with 144 SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) distributed along SSC8.Two trait\u0026#150;associated SNP regions were identified at 93 Mb and 119 Mb on SSC8. The strongest statistical signals of both regions were observed for palmitoleic acid (C16\u0026#58;1(n\u0026#150;7)) content and C18\u0026#58;0\u0026#47;C16\u0026#58;0 and C18\u0026#58;1(n\u0026#150;7)\u0026#47;C16\u0026#58;1(n\u0026#150;7) elongation ratios. MAML3 and SETD7 are positional candidate genes in the 93 Mb region and two novel microsatellites in MAML3 and nine SNPs in SETD7 were identified. No significant association for the MAML3 microsatellite genotypes was detected. The SETD7\u0026#58;c.700G \u0026gt; T SNP, although statistically significant, was not the strongest signal in this region. In addition, the expression of MAML3 and SETD7 in liver and adipose tissue varied among animals, but no association was detected with the polymorphisms in these genes. In the 119 Mb region, the ELOVL6\u0026#58;c.\u0026#150;533C \u0026lt; T polymorphism showed a strong association with percentage of palmitic and palmitoleic fatty acids and elongation ratios in backfat. Our results suggest that the polymorphisms studied in MAML3 and SETD7 are not the causal mutations for the QTL in the 93 Mb region. However, the results for ELOVL6 support the hypothesis that the ELOVL6\u0026#58;c.\u0026#150;533C \u0026gt; T polymorphism has a pleiotropic effect on backfat and intramuscular fatty acid composition and that it has a role in the determination of the QTL in the 119 Mb region.","tags":null,"title":"New insight into the SSC8 genetic determination of fatty acid composition in pigs","type":"publication"}]
