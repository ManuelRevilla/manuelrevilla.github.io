In our study, we used genetic and pre-vaccination blood transcriptomic data to study vaccine effectiveness in pigs. A cohort of 182 Large White pigs was vaccinated against *Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae* (*M. hyo*) at weaning (28 days of age), with a booster 21 days later. Vaccine response was assessed by measuring seric *M. hyo* antibodies (Ab) at 0 (vaccination day), 21 (booster day), 28, 35, and 118 days post-vaccination (dpv). Inter-individual variability of *M. hyo* Ab levels was observed at all time points and the corresponding heritabilities ranged from 0.46 to 0.57. Ab persistence was higher in females than in males. Genome-wide association studies with a 658 K SNP panel revealed two genomic regions associated with variations of M. hyo Ab levels at 21 dpv at positions where immunity-related genes have been mapped, *DAB2IP* on chromosome 1, and *ASAP1*, *CYRIB* and *GSDMC* on chromosome 4. We studied covariations of Ab responses with the pre-vaccination blood transcriptome obtained by RNA-Seq for a subset of 82 pigs. Weighted gene correlation network and differential expression analyses between pigs that differed in Ab responses highlighted biological functions that were enriched in heme biosynthesis and platelet activation for low response at 21 dpv, innate antiviral immunity and dendritic cells for high response at 28 and 35 dpv, and cell adhesion and extracellular matrix for high response at 118 dpv. Sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis identified 101 genes that efficiently predicted divergent responders at all time points. We found weak negative correlations of *M. hyo* Ab levels with body weight traits, which revealed a trade-off that needs to be further explored. We confirmed the influence of the host genetics on vaccine effectiveness to *M. hyo* and provided evidence that the pre-vaccination blood transcriptome co-varies with the Ab response. Our results highlight that both genetic markers and blood biomarkers could be used as potential predictors of vaccine response levels and more studies are required to assess whether they can be exploited in breeding programs.","tags":null,"title":"Influence of genetics and the pre-vaccination blood transcriptome on the variability of antibody levels after vaccination against Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae in pigs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Manuel Revilla**","Guillaume Lenoir","Lo\u0026Iuml;c Flatres-Grall","Rafael Mu\u0026ntilde;oz-Tamayo","Nicolas C Friggens"],"categories":null,"content":"Full citation Revilla, M., Lenoir, G., Flatres-Grall, L., Muñoz-Tamayo, R., Friggens, N.C.

In a perspective of precision livestock farming, it is key to create informative indicators for general resilience and therefore incorporate this concept in breeding goals. In the modern swine breeding industry, new technologies such as automatic feeding system are increasingly common and can be used to capture useful data to monitor animal phenotypes such as feed efficiency. This automatic and longitudinal data collection integrated with mathematical modelling has a great potential to determine accurate resilience indicators, for example by measuring the deviation from expected production levels over a period of time. This work aimed at developing a modelling approach for facilitating the quantification of pig resilience during the fattening period. A total of 13 093 pigs, belonging to three different genetic lines were monitored, and body weight measures registered with automatic feeding systems. We used the Gompertz model and linear interpolation on body weight data to quantify individual deviations from expected production, thereby creating a resilience index. The approach was able to quantify different degrees of perturbation. Further, we evaluated the heritability of the resilience index in the different lines analyzed. Our model-based approach can be useful to quantify pig responses to perturbations using exclusively the growth curves and should contribute to the improvement of swine productive performance.","tags":null,"title":"Quantifying growth perturbations over the fattening period in swine via mathematical modelling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Daniel Crespo-Piazuelo","Lourdes Criado-Mesas","**Manuel Revilla**","Anna Castell\u0026oacute;","Jos\u0026eacute; L Noguera","Ana I Fern\u0026aacute;ndez","Maria Ballester","Josep M Folch"],"categories":null,"content":"Full citation Crespo-Piazuelo, D., Criado-Mesas, L., Revilla, M., Castelló, A., Noguera, J.L., Fernández, A.I., Ballester, M., Folch, J.M.

The present study aimed to find genomic regions associated with the FA composition in backfat and muscle (longissimus dorsi) in 439 pigs with three different genetic backgrounds but having the Iberian breed in common. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were performed between 38,424 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) covering the pig genome and 60 phenotypic traits related to backfat and muscle FA composition. Nine significant associated regions were found in backfat on the Sus scrofa chromosomes (SSC) SSC1, SSC2, SSC4, SSC6, SSC8, SSC10, SSC12, and SSC16. For the intramuscular fat, six significant associated regions were identified on SSC4, SSC13, SSC14, and SSC17. A total of 52 candidate genes were proposed to explain the variation in backfat and muscle FA composition traits. GWAS were also reanalysed including SNPs on five candidate genes (ELOVL6, ELOVL7, FADS2, FASN, and SCD). Regions and molecular markers described in our study may be useful for meat quality selection of commercial pig breeds, although several polymorphisms were breed-specific, and further analysis would be needed to evaluate possible causal mutations.","tags":null,"title":"Identification of strong candidate genes for backfat and intramuscular fatty acid composition in three crosses based on the Iberian pig","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Manuel Revilla"],"categories":["R","cycling","endurance sport"],"content":"In this post I bring you a little portion of my native country, Spain.\nThe Southwestern Europe country houses some of Europe\u0026rsquo;s greatest climbs and is consider a mecca for many roadies.\nThe combination of two important ingredients for cyclism, such as the dominant Mediterranean climate, characterised by warm/hot and dry summers, and the good routes to ride, make this country a must to go for cycling enthusiasts.\nSpain\u0026rsquo;s vast and diverse landscape will have you begging for new cycling destinations to tick off in your bucket list.\nAsturias Thousands of cyclists make the pilgrimage up to Alto de l´Angliru, this mighty ascent is considered one of the most difficult, challenging and hardest climb in the World. The 12.5km track has an average gradient of 10.21%, although one particular section -Cueña les Cabres- reaches a brutal 23.5%. I am sure you will sweat a lot to get to the top, but the reward will be worth.\nNot very far for this region, you will find Parque Nacional de los Picos de Europa (Picos de Europa National Park), described as a theme park for cyclist. Here you do not miss Lagos de Covadonga, a stunning series of lakes -Enol and Ercina lakes- over 1 000m up in the sky, and a mythic ascension of Vuelta a España.\nGranada, Andalucía If you are looking for pure height, in Spain you will also find the highest paved road in Europe, Pico Veleta, in the high mountain of Sierra Nevada. If starting in Granada, it has an astonishing 2 700m elevation gain to its peak and reaches 3 367m at its tallest point. You will feel more an alpine climber than a cyclist.\nIslas Canarias/Islas Baleares But Spain is not only the Iberian Peninsula, the Islands (Islas Baleares and Islas Canarias) also provide an excellent opportunity for cycling. In fact are a popular choice for professionals doing training stages.\nIf you want to do altitude training, Islas Canarias could be your best choice. A popular choice is El Teide with its more than 50km of pure climbing. Is considered the roof of Spain (3 718m), although you can not quite ride to the top.\nFor the other side, Islas Baleares, and specially Mallorca is considered the original cycling mecca. Sa Calobra and Puig Major, are some examples of Mallorca\u0026rsquo;s toughest climbs, but not the only ones.\nCatalonia For many people Spain is synonym of sun and warm days. One of the finest examples of this mixture is The Costa Brava, running from France down to Blanes, a town just northeast of Barcelona. Easily accessible from coastal towns like Begur and the more popular Tossa de Mar, the winding and hilly road that hugs the coastline provides hours of sun-kissed enjoyment. It is one of the most unspoilt coastlines in Spain, and its incredible cliffs and sea views will not disappoint you.\nIf you are more interested in explore the place that so many pros call home, Girona is your destination. The golden combination of city, coast and mountains means that you can explore a plethora of terrain in one single ride, and is the reason that Girona has become a bit of a \u0026lsquo;must visit\u0026rsquo; in recent years.\nThe Pyrenees Last but not least there is The Pyrenees, mountain range covers 430km, and it stretches over both Spain and France. The French side houses many of the most famous climbs, but Spain has plenty to give - and a fair few climbs span the France/Spain border.\nObviously, this is just a glimpse of what Spain as a cycling destination has to offer. It is plenty of good roads and unspotted climbs that must to be explored by yourself.\nPersonal Spain cycling climb bucket list Here, I show you my Spain cycling climb bucket list, a list that I want to increase in the following years.\nBefore check the plot, some aspect should be highlight:\n  \u0026middot; 1.

The gut microbiota is an essential contributor to the availability of nutrients in the animal gut, contributing to its growth, health and immunity.\nMICROFEED will explore the gut microbiota component and its link with the genetic and genomic of feed efficiency and robustness of the host in two unique designs developed to study the pig feed efficiency. The first design relies on 10 generations of divergent selection for feed efficiency in two pig lines fed a conventional diet, to identify and quantify the impact of the gut microbiota potentially co-selected in response to genetic improvement for feed efficiency. The second design is based on a commercial population currently selected for production by the French pig breeders, from which the divergent lines were selected. It will be divided into two sub-designs of related pigs fed either a conventional diet or a high dietary fibers diet more difficult to digest. This second design is the result of collaboration between INRA and the pig breeders grouped in FGPorc in the frame of the H2020 Feed-a-Gene project to study the pig feed efficiency in response to lowered feed quality. In a first step, MICROFEED will produce new data (phenotypes, genotypes) in the two designs (908 pigs in Design 1 and 1700 in Design 2), together with feces samples for partial sequencing (16S) of the gut microbiota (600 + 1600 samples) to evaluate quantitatively the contribution of the gut microbiota to the variability of pig feed efficiency, and to test the effect of diet changes on this contribution. Prediction equations from the gut microbiota and host genomic data will be established. In a second step, whole-metagenome sequencing of 96 samples representing key microbiota profiles for extreme feed efficiency phenotypes, and whole-genome sequencing of 40 pigs best representing the two designs diversity will be obtained. These will be combined to identify the host and gut microbiota genes and functions involved in the feed efficiency of the pig and its robustness to diet changes, and to dissect the underlying biological mechanisms. Finally, external feces samples, genotypes and phenotypes available among the consortium from other projects, including different breeds, feeds, breeding conditions, will be used for validating the prediction equations established in the first step, to test their robustness to these factors and to then propose new selection and management strategies for pig breeding. By identifying which microbes contribute to feed efficiency and which are robustness to feed changes, MICROFEED will propose new genomic tools to jointly pilot the gut microbiota composition and the host genetic in terms of genetic selection for pig breeders, but also in terms of nutrition and feeding for the feeding industry.\nMICROFEED is structured in eight tasks, including one for the project management (Task 0) and one for the dissemination and transfer (Task 7). The two first tasks will concern data acquisition, the three following tasks will concentrate on acquisition of new knowledge on the relationships between host, gut microbiota and feed. Task 6 will validate these results and propose new strategies for selection and feeding.\nThe consortium is composed of seven INRA groups specialized in pig genetics and genomics, feed efficiency and gut microbiota, plus two private partners from the French pig breeding industry representing more than 75% of the French pig genetic market. The total cost of MICROFEED is 1.4 million euros (not including INRA salaries), comprising a contribution of 258 k€ from the private companies and a demand to the ANR of 719 k€, for a labor of 227 person.months during 4 years.\n","date":1583020800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583020800,"objectID":"1715c5d94dc6c8d9e3307f2e3a31a839","permalink":"/project/microfeed-project/","publishdate":"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/microfeed-project/","section":"project","summary":"Understanding the importance of gut microbiota for the improvement of swine efficiency and robustness.","tags":null,"title":"MICROFEED project","type":"project"},{"authors":["Manuel Revilla"],"categories":["R","endurance sport"],"content":"Amateur is a word taken from French, that was present in that language since the XV century, after replacing the popular form \u0026ldquo;amaor\u0026rdquo;, which derives from the Latin \u0026ldquo;amator\u0026rdquo; meaning \u0026ldquo;who loves\u0026rdquo;.

For those who are not familiar with this term, a Major is the conversational style to call a marathon which belongs to the Abbott World Marathon Majors. A series consisting of six of the largest and most renowned marathons in the world. The races take place in Tokyo, Boston, London, Berlin, Chicago and New York City.\nI can\u0026rsquo;t be happier about my first participation in a Major, because I broke my personal record, setting up a finishing time of 02h48'23\u0026rdquo;, which represent a pace of 3'59\u0026rdquo;/km (15.04 km/h).\nIn this plot you can find all my participations and my personal progression in the Philippides (Φιλιππíδης) distance.\n   If you want to dive into my personal marathon participation statistics I invite you to check this summary table.\n   Moreover, in the following tables you can see the all-time top-5 marathoners (men and women), which reflects that human beings have no limits.\n       Source: World Athletics (before International Association of Athletics Federations, IAAF)   In each of my training programs for the marathon I take notes that help me improve my performance, as well as embody my personal experiences.

In a perspective of safe and sustainable food systems, reducing the use of antibiotics in livestock is a major concern. In fact, antibiotic resistance is one of the major medical challenges of the 21st century. The transfer of genes conferring resistance through the environment and the food chain, the potential for development of resistant bacteria and the appearance of therapeutic failures in human medicine, notably due to zoonotic bacteria, constitute major health issues for livestock farming sectors.\nIn the pig breeding industry, the weaning period is often accompanied by a decreased growth rate caused by disparate food intake and diarrhoea due to digestive disorders that might be associated with bacterial population disequilibrium (i.e. dysbiosis) and/or opportunistic intestinal infections. Alarmingly, during this transition period the prophylactic use of antibiotics is still very frequent in order to limit piglet morbidity and mortality. Thus, reducing the prophylactic use of antibiotics in weaning pigs is a main issue and there is a strong need for alternatives. In this context, we have built a public-private partnership that gathers INRA scientists and industries from economic sectors of both animal feeding and pig breeding. PigletBiota is a precompetitive project that will study the physiological and genetic bases of the piglet sensitivity at weaning, as a prerequisite to identify innovative actions to adapt animals and pig production systems to a reduction of antibiotic use.\nThe global aim of the PIGLETBIOTA project is to develop research that will contribute to adapt pig production systems to a reduction of antibiotics. The project proposes an integrative biology approach to determine the main factors influencing the variability of the individual\u0026rsquo;s robustness at weaning. We will monitor piglets for health, immune, stress and zootechnical traits and will characterize the intestinal microbiota diversity and composition as well as the contribution of host\u0026rsquo;s genotypes. The experimental design will combine various environments, including experimental and commercial farms, and ages at weaning and all animals will be fed without antibiotics. Animals (n~1000) will be clinically surveyed, measured for various traits related to production, immunity and stress, and genotyped with high-density SNP chips. The genetic parameters of the sensitivity at weaning will be estimated and genetic association studies performed. Faecal samples before and after the weaning date will be collected for characterizing the dynamics of the gut microbiota and studying its influence on the individual sensitivity at weaning.

During this period, the prophylactic use of antibiotics is still frequent to limit piglet morbidity, which raises both economic and public health concerns such as the appearance of antimicrobial-resistant microbes. With the interest of developing tools for assisting health and management decisions around weaning, it is key to provide robustness indexes that inform on the animals' capacity to endure the challenges associated with weaning. This work aimed at developing a modelling approach for facilitating the quantification of piglet resilience to weaning. A total of 325 Large White pigs weaned at 28 days of age were monitored and further housed and fed conventionally during the post-weaning period without antibiotic administration. Body weight and diarrhoea scores were recorded before and after weaning, and blood was sampled at weaning and 1 week later for collecting haematological data. A dynamic model was constructed based on the Gompertz-Makeham law to describe live weight trajectories during the first 75 days after weaning, following the rationale that the animal response is partitioned in two time windows (a perturbation and a recovery window). Model calibration was performed for each animal. Our results show that the transition time between the two time windows, as well as the weight trajectories are characteristic for each individual. The model captured the weight dynamics of animals at different degrees of perturbation, with an average coefficient of determination of 0.99, and a concordance correlation coefficient of 0.99. The utility of the model is that it provides biologically meaningful parameters that inform on the amplitude and length of perturbation, and the rate of animal recovery. Our rationale is that the dynamics of weight inform on the capability of the animal to cope with the weaning disturbance. Indeed, there were significant correlations between model parameters and individual diarrhoea scores and haematological traits. Overall, the parameters of our model can be useful for constructing weaning robustness indexes by using exclusively the growth curves. We foresee that this modelling approach will provide a step forward in the quantitative characterisation of robustness.","tags":null,"title":"Towards the quantitative characterisation of piglets' robustness to weaning: a modelling approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Daniel Crespo-Piazuelo","Lourdes Criado-Mesas","**Manuel Revilla**","Anna Castell\u0026oacute;","Ana I Fern\u0026aacute;ndez","Josep M Folch","Maria Ballester"],"categories":null,"content":"Full Citation Crespo-Piazuelo, D., Criado-Mesas, L., Revilla, M., Castelló, A., Fernández, A.I., Folch, J.M., Ballester, M.

Through processes of natural adaptation and selective breeding, the accumulation of mutations has driven the genetic divergence between pig breeds. The most common and well-studied mutations are single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). However, insertions and deletions (indels) usually represents a fifth part of the detected mutations and should also be considered for animal breeding. In the present study, three different programs (*Dindel, SAMtools mpileup,* and *GATK*) were used to detect indels from Whole Genome Sequencing data of Iberian boars and Landrace sows. A total of 1,928,746 indels were found in common with the three programs. The *VEP* tool predicted that 1,289 indels may have a high impact on protein sequence and function. Ten indels inside genes related with lipid metabolism were genotyped in pigs from three different backcrosses with Iberian origin, obtaining different allelic frequencies on each backcross. Genome-Wide Association Studies performed in the *Longissimus dorsi* muscle found an association between an indel located in the C1q and TNF related 12 (*C1QTNF12*) gene and the amount of eicosadienoic acid (C20:2(n-6)).","tags":null,"title":"Indel detection from Whole Genome Sequencing data and association with lipid metabolism in pigs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Daniel Crespo-Piazuelo","Lourdes Migura-Garcia","Jordi Estell\u0026eacute;","Lourdes Criado-Mesas","**Manuel Revilla**","Anna Castell\u0026oacute;","Mar\u0026iacute;a Mu\u0026ntilde;oz","Juan M.

The aim of this study was to describe the microbiome composition, distribution and interaction along the Iberian pig intestinal tract and its role in whole-body energy homeostasis. The V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced from the microbiomes of five gut sections (duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and proximal and distal colon) in thirteen castrated male pigs. A total of 1,669 operational taxonomic units distributed in 179 genera were found among all samples. The two most abundant genera in the small intestine were *Lactobacillus* and *Clostridium*, while *Prevotella* was predominant in the colon. The colon samples were more similar among the pigs and richer in species than the small intestine samples were. In the small intestine, the metagenome prediction pointed to rapid internalization and conversion of the available simple carbohydrates for microbial proliferation and maintenance. In the colon, a competition among anaerobic bacteria for plant polysaccharide degradation to produce short chain fatty acids was found. This study confirms that the energy pathways of the gut microbiome differ along its sections and provides a description of the correlations between genera.","tags":null,"title":"Characterization of bacterial microbiota compositions along the intestinal tract in pigs and their interactions and functions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Manuel Revilla**","Anna Puig-Oliveras","Daniel Crespo-Piazuelo","Lourdes Criado-Mesas","Anna Castell\u0026oacute;","Ana I Fern\u0026aacute;ndez","Maria Ballester","Josep M Folch"],"categories":null,"content":"Full citation Revilla, M., Puig-Oliveras, A., Crespo-Piazuelo, D., Criado-Mesas, L., Castelló, A., Fernández, A.I., Ballester, M., Folch, J.M.

Hence, understanding the molecular mechanisms affecting meat production and quality would help in the selection of these traits. Meat quality is determined largely by its fatty acid (FA) composition and understanding the underlying molecular processes of FA composition is the general objective of this thesis.\nWe analyzed quantitative trait loci (QTL) on porcine chromosome 8 (SCC8) for FA composition in backfat, identifying two trait-associated SNP regions at 93 Mb and 119 Mb. The strongest statistical signals for both regions were observed for palmitoleic acid and, C18:0/C16:0 and C18:1(n-7)/C16:1(n-7) elongation ratios. MAML3 and SETD7 genes were analyzed as positional candidate genes in the 93 Mb region. The two novel microsatellites analyzed in the MAML3 gene, and the SETD7:c.700G\u0026gt;T SNP in the SETD7 gene did not show the strongest signal in this region, discarding these polymorphisms as the causal mutations. Furthermore, in the 119 Mb region, the ELOVL6:c.-533C\u0026gt;T SNP showed a strong association with the percentage of palmitic and palmitoleic acids and elongation ratios in backfat. These results for ELOVL6 gene, support the hypothesis that it has a pleiotropic effect in backfat and muscle for the 119 Mb QTL, and reinforce this gene as a strong candidate for the SSC8 QTL for FA composition.\nMoreover, whole genome sequence (WGS) data from Iberian and Landrace pigs were used to identify 1,279 copy number variations (CNVs), merging into 540 swine CNV regions (CNVRs). The impact of four of them in growth and FA composition in intramuscular fat and backfat was studied. Association with carcass length and FA composition in backfat and intramuscular fat was showed for the CNVR112, containing the GPAT2 gene which catalyse the biosynthesis of triglycerides and glycerophospholipids. These results underline the importance of CNVRs affecting economically important traits in pigs.\nFinally, the adipose tissue mRNA expression of 44 candidate genes related with lipid metabolism was analyzed in 115 animals. The expression genome-wide association (eGWAS) identified 193 eSNPs located in 19 expression QTLs (eQTLs). Three out of 19 eQTLs corresponding to ACSM5, FABP4, and FADS2 were classified as cis-acting eQTLs, whereas the remaining 16 eQTLs had trans-regulatory effects. These findings and the polymorphisms evaluated for some of these genes provide new data to further understand the functional mechanisms implicated in the variation of meat quality traits in pigs.\nFull citation Revilla, M.

In the present study, a genomic analysis of porcine CNVs based on next-generation sequencing data was carried out to identify CNVs segregating in an Iberian x Landrace backcross population and study their association with fatty acid composition and growth-related traits. A total of 1,279 CNVs, including duplications and deletions, were detected, ranging from 106 to 235 CNVs across samples, with an average of 183 CNVs per sample. Moreover, we detected 540 CNV regions (CNVRs) containing 245 genes. Functional annotation suggested that these genes possess a great variety of molecular functions and may play a role in production traits in commercial breeds. Some of the identified CNVRs contained relevant functional genes (e.g., *CLCA4, CYP4X1, GPAT2, MOGAT2, PLA2G2A* and *PRKG1*, among others). The variation in copy number of four of them (*CLCA4, GPAT2, MOGAT2* and *PRKG1*) was validated in 150 BC1_LD (25% Iberian and 75% Landrace) animals by qPCR. Additionally, their contribution regarding backfat and intramuscular fatty acid composition and growth-related traits was analyzed. Statistically significant associations were obtained for CNVR112 (*GPAT2*) for the C18:2(n-6)/C18:3(n-3) ratio in backfat and carcass length, among others. Notably, GPATs are enzymes that catalyze the first step in the biosynthesis of both triglycerides and glycerophospholipids, suggesting that this CNVR may contribute to genetic variation in fatty acid composition and growth traits. These findings provide useful genomic information to facilitate the further identification of trait-related CNVRs affecting economically important traits in pigs.","tags":null,"title":"A global analysis of CNVs in swine using whole genome sequence data and association analysis with fatty acid composition and growth traits","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maria Ballester","Yuliaxis Ramayo-Caldas","**Manuel Revilla**","Jordi Corominas","Anna Castell\u0026oacute;","Jordi Estell\u0026eacute;","Ana I Fern\u0026aacute;ndez","Josep M Folch"],"categories":null,"content":"Full citation Ballester, M., Ramayo-Caldas, Y., Revilla, M., Corominas, J., Castelló, A., Estellé, J., Fernández, A.I., Folch, J.M.

The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) *ELOVL6\u0026#58;c.-533C \u0026gt; T* located in the promoter region of *ELOVL6* was found to be highly associated with *ELOVL6* expression and, accordingly, with the percentages of palmitic and palmitoleic acids in longissimus dorsi and adipose tissue. The main goal of the current work was to further study the role of *ELOVL6* on these traits by analyzing the regulation of the expression of *ELOVL6* and the implication of *ELOVL6* polymorphisms on meat quality traits in pigs. High-throughput sequencing of BAC clones that contain the porcine *ELOVL6* gene coupled to RNAseq data re-analysis showed that two isoforms of this gene are expressed in liver and adipose tissue and that they differ in number of exons and 3\u0026acute;UTR length. Although several SNPs in the 3\u0026acute;UTR of *ELOVL6* were associated with palmitic and palmitoleic acid contents, this association was lower than that previously observed with SNP *ELOVL6\u0026#58;c.-533C \u0026gt; T*. This SNP is in full linkage disequilibrium with SNP *ELOVL6\u0026#58;c.-394G \u0026gt; A* that was identified in the binding site for estrogen receptor alpha (ER\u0026alpha;). Interestingly, the *ELOVL6\u0026#58;c.-394G* allele is associated with an increase in methylation levels of the *ELOVL6* promoter and with a decrease of *ELOVL6* expression. Therefore, ER\u0026alpha; is clearly a good candidate to explain the regulation of *ELOVL6* expression through dynamic epigenetic changes in the binding site of known regulators of *ELOVL6* gene, such as SREBF1 and SP1.

The use of network approaches considering the interactions of multiple molecules and traits provides useful insights into the molecular underpinnings of complex traits. Here, a network based methodology, named Association Weight Matrix, was applied to study gene interactions and pathways affecting pig conformation, growth and fatness traits. The co-association network analysis underpinned three transcription factors, *PPAR\u0026gamma;*, *ELF1*, and *PRDM16* involved in mesoderm tissue differentiation. Fifty-four genes in the network belonged to growth-related ontologies and 46 of them were common with a similar study for growth in cattle supporting our results. The functional analysis uncovered the lipid metabolism and the corticotrophin and gonadotrophin release hormone pathways among the most important pathways influencing these traits. Our results suggest that the genes and pathways here identified are important determining either the total body weight of the animal and the fat content. For instance, a switch in the mesoderm tissue differentiation may determinate the age-related preferred pathways being in the puberty stage those related with the miogenic and osteogenic lineages; on the contrary, in the maturity stage cells may be more prone to the adipocyte fate. Hence, our results demonstrate that an integrative genomic co-association analysis is a powerful approach for identifying new connections and interactions among genes. This work provides insights about pathways and key regulators which may be important determining the animal growth, conformation and body proportions and fatness traits. Molecular information concerning genes and pathways here described may be crucial for the improvement of genetic breeding programs applied to pork meat production.","tags":null,"title":"A co-association network analysis of the genetic determination of pig conformation, growth and fatness","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Manuel Revilla**","Yuliaxis Ramayo-Caldas","Anna Castell\u0026oacute;","Jordi Corominas","Anna Puig-Oliveras","Noelia Iba\u0026ntilde;ez-Escriche","Mar\u0026iacute;a Mu\u0026ntilde;oz","Maria Ballester","Josep M Folch"],"categories":null,"content":"Full citation Revilla, M., Ramayo-Caldas, R., Castelló, A., Corominas, J., Puig-Oliveras, A., Ibañez-Escriche, N., Muñoz, M., Ballester, M., Folch, J.M.

A QTL (quantitative trait locus) for fatty acid composition in backfat was previously detected on porcine chromosome 8 (SSC8) in an Iberian x Landrace F2 intercross. More recently, a genome-wide association study detected the same genomic region for muscle fatty acid composition in an Iberian x Landrace backcross population. *ELOVL6*, a strong positional candidate gene for this QTL, contains a polymorphism in its promoter region (*ELOVL6\u0026#58;c.-533C \u0026lt; T*), which is associated with percentage of palmitic and palmitoleic acids in muscle and adipose tissues. Here, a combination of single-marker association and the haplotype-based approach was used to analyze backfat fatty acid composition in 470 animals of an Iberian x Landrace F2 intercross genotyped with 144 SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) distributed along SSC8.Two trait-associated SNP regions were identified at 93 Mb and 119 Mb on SSC8. The strongest statistical signals of both regions were observed for palmitoleic acid (C16\u0026#58;1(n-7)) content and C18\u0026#58;0\u0026#47;C16\u0026#58;0 and C18\u0026#58;1(n-7)\u0026#47;C16\u0026#58;1(n-7) elongation ratios. *MAML3* and *SETD7* are positional candidate genes in the 93 Mb region and two novel microsatellites in *MAML3* and nine SNPs in *SETD7* were identified. No significant association for the *MAML3* microsatellite genotypes was detected. The *SETD7\u0026#58;c.700G \u0026gt; T* SNP, although statistically significant, was not the strongest signal in this region. In addition, the expression of *MAML3* and *SETD7* in liver and adipose tissue varied among animals, but no association was detected with the polymorphisms in these genes. In the 119 Mb region, the *ELOVL6\u0026#58;c.-533C \u0026lt; T* polymorphism showed a strong association with percentage of palmitic and palmitoleic fatty acids and elongation ratios in backfat. Our results suggest that the polymorphisms studied in *MAML3* and *SETD7* are not the causal mutations for the QTL in the 93 Mb region. However, the results for *ELOVL6* support the hypothesis that the *ELOVL6\u0026#58;c.-533C \u0026gt; T* polymorphism has a pleiotropic effect on backfat and intramuscular fatty acid composition and that it has a role in the determination of the QTL in the 119 Mb region.","tags":null,"title":"New insight into the SSC8 genetic determination of fatty acid composition in pigs","type":"publication"}]
