With a Degree in Veterinary Medicine (DVM) from [Extremadura University](https://www.unex.es/?set_language=es&cl=es "Extremadura University") (UNEX, Spain) and a PhD in Animal Production from [Autonomous University of Barcelona ](https://www.uab.cat/web/universitat-autonoma-de-barcelona-1345467954409.html "Autonomous University of Barcelona ") (UAB, Spain), I have dedicated my career to advancing the understanding of complex traits in animal genetics.

As a Postdoctoral Researcher from 2017 to 2020, I split my time between the [Animal Genetics and Integrative Biology (GABI)](https://www6.jouy.inrae.fr/gabi_eng/ "Animal Genetics and Integrative Biology (GABI)") research unit at [INRAE](https://www.inrae.fr/en "INRAE") in Jouy-en-Josas and the [Systemic modeling applied to ruminants (MoSAR)](https://www6.jouy.inrae.fr/mosar_eng/UMR-MoSAR "Systemic modeling applied to ruminants (MoSAR)") research unit at [AgroParisTech](http://www2.agroparistech.fr/Welcome-to-AgroParisTech.html "AgroParisTech") in Paris, France. During this period, I focused on applying statistical and computational tools to unravel the genetic underpinnings of various traits in pigs.

Since 2020, I have been a Geneticist at [Hendrix Genetics](https://www.hendrix-genetics.com/en/ "Hendrix Genetics") in Boxmeer, the Netherlands, specializing in genotypes and genomic evaluations across multiple species including swine, turkeys, layers, poultry, salmon, shrimp, and trout.

In 2022, I transitioned to a role within the Swine brand of Hendrix Genetics, [Hypor](https://www.hypor.com/en/ "Hypor"), where I am dedicated to enhancing pig lines through continuous genetic improvement for the pork supply chain, from producers to consumers.

Since 2023, I serve as the Global Product Management Coordinator for Hypor, managing global product strategy and image throughout the product lifecycle. 

My roles and responsibilities include:

1.  Engaging in product management, collaborating with Sales, R&D, Operation, Marketing, and Quality departments.
2.  Coordinating the design, execution, and maintenance of customer performance benchmark systems and trials.
3.  Briefing and training regional and local sales forces on product development updates.
4.  Guiding product changes from conception to production, continuously improving project management processes with a lean philosophy.
5.  Participating in conferences and events to understand global market needs and trends, and marketing products and communication content.

Moreover, collaborating cross-departmentally to improve internal processes and creating sales opportunities are also my ambitions.
