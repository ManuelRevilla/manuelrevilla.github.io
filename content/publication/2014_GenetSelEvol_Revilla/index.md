abstract: Fat content and fatty acid composition in swine are becoming increasingly studied because of their effect on sensory and nutritional quality of meat. A QTL (quantitative trait locus) for fatty acid composition in backfat was previously detected on porcine chromosome 8 (SSC8) in an Iberian x Landrace F2 intercross. More recently, a genome-wide association study detected the same genomic region for muscle fatty acid composition in an Iberian x Landrace backcross population. *ELOVL6*, a strong positional candidate gene for this QTL, contains a polymorphism in its promoter region (*ELOVL6&#58;c.-533C &lt; T*), which is associated with percentage of palmitic and palmitoleic acids in muscle and adipose tissues. Here, a combination of single-marker association and the haplotype-based approach was used to analyze backfat fatty acid composition in 470 animals of an Iberian x Landrace F<sub>2</sub> intercross genotyped with 144 SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) distributed along SSC8.Two trait-associated SNP regions were identified at 93 Mb and 119 Mb on SSC8. The strongest statistical signals of both regions were observed for palmitoleic acid (C16&#58;1(n-7)) content and C18&#58;0&#47;C16&#58;0 and C18&#58;1(n-7)&#47;C16&#58;1(n-7) elongation ratios. *MAML3* and *SETD7* are positional candidate genes in the 93 Mb region and two novel microsatellites in *MAML3* and nine SNPs in *SETD7* were identified. No significant association for the *MAML3* microsatellite genotypes was detected. The *SETD7&#58;c.700G &gt; T* SNP, although statistically significant, was not the strongest signal in this region. In addition, the expression of *MAML3* and *SETD7* in liver and adipose tissue varied among animals, but no association was detected with the polymorphisms in these genes. In the 119 Mb region, the *ELOVL6&#58;c.-533C &lt; T* polymorphism showed a strong association with percentage of palmitic and palmitoleic fatty acids and elongation ratios in backfat. Our results suggest that the polymorphisms studied in *MAML3* and *SETD7* are not the causal mutations for the QTL in the 93 Mb region. However, the results for *ELOVL6* support the hypothesis that the *ELOVL6&#58;c.-533C &gt; T* polymorphism has a pleiotropic effect on backfat and intramuscular fatty acid composition and that it has a role in the determination of the QTL in the 119 Mb region.
