abstract: In previous studies on an Iberian x Landrace cross, we have provided evidence that supported the porcine <i>ELOVL6</i> gene as the major causative gene of the QTL on pig chromosome 8 for palmitic and palmitoleic acid contents in muscle and backfat. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) <i>ELOVL6&#58;c.&#150;533C &gt; T</i> located in the promoter region of <i>ELOVL6</i> was found to be highly associated with <i>ELOVL6</i> expression and, accordingly, with the percentages of palmitic and palmitoleic acids in longissimus dorsi and adipose tissue. The main goal of the current work was to further study the role of <i>ELOVL6</i> on these traits by analyzing the regulation of the expression of <i>ELOVL6</i> and the implication of <i>ELOVL6</i> polymorphisms on meat quality traits in pigs. High&#150;throughput sequencing of BAC clones that contain the porcine <i>ELOVL6</i> gene coupled to RNAseq data re&#150;analysis showed that two isoforms of this gene are expressed in liver and adipose tissue and that they differ in number of exons and 3&acute;UTR length. Although several SNPs in the 3&acute;UTR of <i>ELOVL6</i> were associated with palmitic and palmitoleic acid contents, this association was lower than that previously observed with SNP <i>ELOVL6&#58;c.&#150;533C &gt; T</i>. This SNP is in full linkage disequilibrium with SNP <i>ELOVL6&#58;c.&#150;394G &gt; A</i> that was identified in the binding site for estrogen receptor alpha (ER&alpha;). Interestingly, the <i>ELOVL6&#58;c.&#150;394G</i> allele is associated with an increase in methylation levels of the <i>ELOVL6</i> promoter and with a decrease of <i>ELOVL6</i> expression. Therefore, ER&alpha; is clearly a good candidate to explain the regulation of <i>ELOVL6</i> expression through dynamic epigenetic changes in the binding site of known regulators of <i>ELOVL6</i> gene, such as SREBF1 and SP1. Our results strongly suggest the <i>ELOVL6&#58;c.&#150;394G &gt; A</i> polymorphism as the causal mutation for the QTL on pig chromosome 8 that affects fatty acid composition in pigs.
