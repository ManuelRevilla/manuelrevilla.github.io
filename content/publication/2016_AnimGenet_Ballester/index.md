abstract: <i>APOA2</i> is a protein implicated in triglyceride, fatty acid and glucose metabolism. In pigs, the <i>APOA2</i> gene is located on pig chromosome 4 (SSC4) in a QTL region affecting fatty acid composition, fatness and growth traits. In this study, we evaluated <i>APOA2</i> as a candidate gene for meat quality traits in an Iberian x Landrace backcross population. The <i>APOA2:c.131T&gt;A</i> polymorphism, located in exon 3 of <i>APOA2</i> and determining a missense mutation, was associated with the percentage of hexadecenoic acid &#91;C16&#58;1(n&#150;9)&#93;, linoleic acid &#91;C18&#58;2(n&#150;6)&#93;, &alpha;&#150;linolenic acid &#91;C18&#58;3(n&#150;3)&#93;, dihomo&#150;gamma&#150;linolenic acid &#91;C20&#58;3(n&#150;6)&#93; and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in backfat. Furthermore, this SNP was associated with the global mRNA expression levels of <i>APOA2</i> in liver and was used as a marker to determine allelic expression imbalance by pyrosequencing. We determined an overexpression of the <i>T</i> allele in heterozygous samples with a mean ratio of 2.8 (<i>T&#47;A</i>), observing a high variability in the allelic expression among individuals. This result suggests that complex regulatory mechanisms, beyond a single polymorphism (e.g. epigenetic effects or multiple cis&#150;acting polymorphisms), may be regulating <i>APOA2</i> gene expression.
