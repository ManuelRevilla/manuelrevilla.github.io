abstract: The *APOA2* gene is a protein implicated in triglyceride, fatty acid and glucose metabolism. In pigs, the *APOA2* gene is located on pig chromosome 4 (SSC4) in a QTL region affecting fatty acid composition, fatness and growth traits. In this study, we evaluated *APOA2* as a candidate gene for meat quality traits in an Iberian x Landrace backcross population. The *APOA2:c.131T&gt;A* polymorphism, located in exon 3 of *APOA2* and determining a missense mutation, was associated with the percentage of hexadecenoic acid [C16:1(n-9)], linoleic acid [C18:2(n-6)], &alpha;-linolenic acid [C18:3(n-3)], dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid [C20:3(n-6)] and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in backfat. Furthermore, this SNP was associated with the global mRNA expression levels of *APOA2* in liver and was used as a marker to determine allelic expression imbalance by pyrosequencing. We determined an overexpression of the *T* allele in heterozygous samples with a mean ratio of 2.8 (*T&#47;A*), observing a high variability in the allelic expression among individuals. This result suggests that complex regulatory mechanisms, beyond a single polymorphism (e.g. epigenetic effects or multiple cis-acting polymorphisms), may be regulating *APOA2* gene expression.
