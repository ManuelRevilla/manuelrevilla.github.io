abstract: The aim of this work is to better understand the genetic mechanisms determining two complex traits affecting porcine meat quality&#58; intramuscular fat (IMF) content and its fatty acid (FA) composition. With this purpose, expression Genome&#150;Wide Association Study (eGWAS) of 45 lipid&#150;related genes associated with meat quality traits in swine muscle (<i>Longissimus dorsi</i>) of 114 Iberian x Landrace backcross animals was performed. The eGWAS identified 241 SNPs associated with 11 genes&#58; <i>ACSM5, CROT, FABP3, FOS, HIF1AN, IGF2, MGLL, NCOA1, PIK3R1, PLA2G12A</i> and <i>PPARA</i>. Three expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTLs) for <i>IGF2, ACSM5</i> and <i>MGLL</i> were identified, showing <i>cis</i>&#150;acting effects, whereas 16 eQTLs had <i>trans</i> regulatory effects. A polymorphism in the <i>ACSM5</i> promoter region associated with its expression was identified. In addition, strong candidate genes regulating <i>ACSM5, FOS, PPARA, PIK3R1, PLA2G12A</i> and <i>HIF1AN</i> gene expression were also seen. Notably, the analysis highlighted the NR3C1 transcription factor as a strong candidate gene involved in the regulation of the 45 genes analysed. Finally, the <i>IGF2, MGLL, MC2R, ARHGAP6,</i> and <i>NR3C1</i> genes were identified as potential regulators co&#150;localizing within QTLs for fatness and growth traits in the IBMAP population. The results obtained increase our knowledge in the functional regulatory mechanisms involved in these complex traits.
