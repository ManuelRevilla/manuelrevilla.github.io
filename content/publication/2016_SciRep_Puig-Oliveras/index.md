abstract: The aim of this work is to better understand the genetic mechanisms determining two complex traits affecting porcine meat quality&#58; intramuscular fat (IMF) content and its fatty acid (FA) composition. With this purpose, expression Genome-Wide Association Study (eGWAS) of 45 lipid-related genes associated with meat quality traits in swine muscle (*Longissimus dorsi*) of 114 Iberian x Landrace backcross animals was performed. The eGWAS identified 241 SNPs associated with 11 genes&#58; *ACSM5, CROT, FABP3, FOS, HIF1AN, IGF2, MGLL, NCOA1, PIK3R1, PLA2G12A* and *PPARA*. Three expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTLs) for *IGF2, ACSM5* and *MGLL* were identified, showing *cis*-acting effects, whereas 16 eQTLs had *trans* regulatory effects. A polymorphism in the *ACSM5* promoter region associated with its expression was identified. In addition, strong candidate genes regulating *ACSM5, FOS, PPARA, PIK3R1, PLA2G12A* and *HIF1AN* gene expression were also seen. Notably, the analysis highlighted the NR3C1 transcription factor as a strong candidate gene involved in the regulation of the 45 genes analysed. Finally, the *IGF2, MGLL, MC2R, ARHGAP6,* and *NR3C1* genes were identified as potential regulators co-localizing within QTLs for fatness and growth traits in the IBMAP population. The results obtained increase our knowledge in the functional regulatory mechanisms involved in these complex traits.
